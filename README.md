## 2. Features

Our Image Steganography Software is designed to offer the following key features:

- **Encode Messages**: It allows users to embed messages or data within images, making them suitable for secure communication.
- **Decode Messages**: Users can extract hidden messages from steganographic images.
- **Image Format Support**: The software supports a variety of image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and more.
- **Password Protection**: Users can protect their steganographic images with a password for added security.
- **Python and MATLAB Integration**: By integrating Python and MATLAB, we've created a powerful tool for steganography that combines their strengths.

## 3. Prerequisites

To use the software effectively, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python**: Install Python 3.6 or higher. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **MATLAB**: The software requires MATLAB R2017b or a newer version. You can acquire MATLAB from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

- **Python Packages**: Install the following Python packages using `pip`:

  - NumPy
  - Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

- **MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox**: Ensure you have the Image Processing Toolbox installed in MATLAB.

## 4. Installation

Follow these steps to install the software:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teammates/image-steganography.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-steganography
   ```

3. Ensure that you have all the prerequisites mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

## 5. Usage

Using our Image Steganography Software is easy:

1. Open a command-line terminal or shell.

2. Navigate to the project directory where the software is located.

3. To encode a message within an image, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python encode.py input_image.jpg output_image.jpg "Your secret message" -p "YourPassword"
   ```

   Replace `input_image.jpg` with the path to the input image, `output_image.jpg` with the path for the steganographic image, `"Your secret message"` with the message you want to hide, and `"YourPassword"` with the desired password for encryption.

4. To decode a message from a steganographic image, use this command:

   ```bash
   python decode.py steganographic_image.jpg -p "YourPassword"
   ```

   Replace `steganographic_image.jpg` with the path to the steganographic image and `"YourPassword"` with the password used during encoding.
